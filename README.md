# My First Gatsby Template

## How to get started

First, install the `gatsby-cli` if you don't have it already:
```bash
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

Then, to create a new Gatsby project using this template, run the following command:
```bash
gatsby new your-site-name https://github.com/MinimumViablePerson/my-first-gatsby-template
```

Once that's done, cd into the newly created folder.

## Working with Gatsby

```bash
gatbsy develop
```

To build the site for deployment, run:
```bash
gatsby build
```

To serve the build folder, run:
```bash
gatsby serve
```
